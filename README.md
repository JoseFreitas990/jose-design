# A place where I experiment and develop pages/sections with animations

This always-in-development project was meant to try out animations and save them for future use.

## See it for yourself

## Everything isn't perfect

This code serves as foundation and quick example of some animation I could use in the future.
Things such as responsiveness weren't taken in mind, this was developed to look good in a screen with 1920x1080p resolution.
